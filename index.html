          <h2>The Question</h2>
          <p class="lead">TELL AND SHOW your data story and visualizations. Notice how this paragraph appears in a larger font than others, because the HTML code begins with a "lead" class.</p>

          <p>For my Question, in Build 4 Create Meaningful Data Story I will be addressing A3: In each town, how many students are educated in a different district, and how has it changed over time? This data matters because Connecticut education systems and schools need to be aware if students are seeking education and learning from outside their district. Is this because they find charter, magnet, and technical schools better? Or is it because they are not offered a beneficial opportunity within their public, in their district? These questions are explored by my map making. </p>

          <p>Everyone must demonstrate their ability to create their own sample version for the quiz. Later, if two people are working together to co-author one data story, you may wish to create ONE GitHub account that both of you can access. But only one person at a time can make edits.</p>

          <p>In your GitHub copy of this template, open the `index.html` file to see how everything must be written in HTML format. Click the pencil symbol in GithHub to edit the file. HINT: In the upper-right corner, switch the dropdown menu from `No Wrap` to `Soft Wrap` to easily view long segments of code in your screen.</p>

          <p>Paragraphs like this one must begin with a `p` tag and end with a `p` closing tag.</p>

          <p>Links must begin and end with `a` anchor tags, with the web address inside either single or double quotes. If you need guidance, check out this <a href='https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GC9Hp/2/'>Link to Live Link</a>.

          <p>When describing charts, maps, or tables that appear further below, refer to them "...as shown in Figure 1" or "...as shown in Table 1" and include those figure/table numbers in the titles or captions below.</p>

          <p>Embed each of your published visualizations as an HTML iframe code, following instructions in <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/embed.html'>Chapter 9 of HODV</a>, similar to the sample below.</p>

          <iframe title="Percent Share of Select Nations Around the World 2010-2019" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-j0l26" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/j0l26/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="421" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

          <h2>My Steps to Find my Answers</h2>
          <p>For my information, I had to look into the data from all 33 Hartford area Districts. Each town was reported with total students educated from their district. According to CT.Gov|EDSIGHT, they reported the total enrollment for each respective town or district. To address my question, I had to calculate the total number of students educated outside of their district. For this, I took the total number of residents educated in said district, or the enrollment number, and subtracted it by the students in the ‘Public School’ section. This shows the difference of students that are not educated in the districts’ traditional public schools. To calculate this change of time I had to then look into data from previous years. I chose the earliest year I could find, the years 2016-2017. I was given a number, which resembled mostly a smaller change, except for Manchester, Bloomfield, East Hartford, Hartford, New Britain, Windsor, and West Hartford. I then added the total enrollment. My next calculation was the percent educated outside of traditional schools in the district. These numbers allowed for a more precise understanding of each town's disparity and students getting educated somewhere else. I also did the same thing for the 2021-2022 data.</p>

          <h2>Finding My Answers</h2>
          <p>Sheet3 in my data tab shows the percentage point difference from 2017-2022, showing the gradual growth or decline of the percentage of students being educated outside of the traditional school in their given town. **Here is the percentage change of the findings I found** Here is the live link to the choropleth map I created highlighting the changes from the years 2016-2022 https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vbeuS/2/.</p>

          <p> From the year 2021-2022, you can see the darker toned shades of blue are districts with students tending to be more likely educated outside their traditional school. Here is the live link with this map I created. https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nnfhc/1/ 
It is important to also highlight the percentage point difference, which gives a key indicator whether the district has grown or decreased in students being educated outside of the given district they were intended to be educated by a traditional school. Here is the live link map to this Choropleth map. https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vBXbW/1/.</p>

          <h2>Section 4: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          <table class="tg">

            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">987</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">654</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">321</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
          </table>
