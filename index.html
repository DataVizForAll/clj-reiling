          <h2>Exploring The Question: Introduction</h2>
         

          <p>For my Question,  I dove into the research of students' education, specifically if they are leaving their traditional schools to receive outside education. This data is crucial to towns because they need to be aware of the percent of students staying within their district to receive education. Towns can look at this percentage of students leaving their traditional school in correlation with how their school systems are performing, or if there are enough opportunities being offered. However, we found towns with the highest populations had students tending to leave more often such as Hartford or New Britain. One key question we explored was are these students not being offered a beneficial opportunity within their public, in their district?   </p>

          <h2>My Key Findings</h2>
          
          <p>We found the majority of students who left tend to be from towns such as Hartford, New Britain, and Bloomfield. In this Choropleth Map, we found this information through the data taken from the school years 2016-2017 to 2021-2022. You can clearly see the percentage point difference map illustrates the change in time and the percentage increase of students leaving their district to receive education outside their traditional district for Hartford, Bloomfield, East Hartford, Manchester, and New Britain. In the 2016-2017 school year, Avon had a total of 86 students educated outside of their traditional school district. In 2021-2022 they had 145 students educated outside of their traditional school district. This can be correlated to a 2.0% Point Percentage increase as well.

            </iframe> 
              <a href='https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vBXbW/3/'> Here is a live link chart of the information </a> . Why does this matter? For towns such as Windsor, they have a better understanding students are staying within their region to be educated. Windsor and other towns like Coventry know that their education system can be credited to some success over the last 6 school years, but more importantly, they know students and families are depending on their traditional schools now more than ever. </p>
          <p>It is important to note the overall change, however, the amount of students being educated is also key. Hartford had 12,000 students educated outside of their district, but New Britain, the second most populous town had the second most at 2,827 students being educated outside their district.<a href='https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nnfhc/2/'> Here is a live link to the data  </a>. This data allows us to understand the numbers of students being educated outside their district. Understanding the change over time is important, but the amount of students is key for comparison of other towns and their relations. </p>
          <p>For the final key finding, here is a table of students being educated outside of their district. The table exhibits the two school years of 2016-2017 and 2021-2022. As you can see, this can be correlated to the students' growth in time but this hones in on the two specific years. You can see serious growth in towns like Bloomfield and Hartford. Below is a static image of the findings and of the table.  </p>

          <h2>Finding My Answers</h2>
          <p>For my information, I had to look into the data from all 33 Hartford area towns. Each town was reported with total students educated from their district. According to <a href='<a href='>CT.Gov|EDSIGHT'>CT.Gov|EDSIGHT</a>, they reported the total enrollment for each respective town or district. To address my question, I had to calculate the total number of students educated outside of their district. For this, I took the total number of residents educated in said district, or the enrollment number, and subtracted it by the students in the ‘Public School’ section. This shows the difference of students that are not educated in the districts’ traditional public schools. To calculate this change of time I had to then look into data from previous years. I chose the earliest year I could find, the years 2016-2017. I was given a number, which resembled mostly a smaller change, except for Manchester, Bloomfield, East Hartford, Hartford, New Britain, Windsor, and West Hartford. I then added the total enrollment. My next calculation was the percent educated outside of traditional schools in the district. These numbers allowed for a more precise understanding of each town's disparity and students getting educated somewhere else. I also did the same thing for the 2021-2022 data. I was able to find the Point Percentage difference as well, a key finding in my work that explains this story. All of this work was calculated in my <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WVMvT9ZF_x_knl-SP6R3zAuJNo_jcv1P4DtB3hQDAXE/edit#gid=481851464'> Google Sheet </a>. </p>

          <h2>Conclusion and Credits/Work cited</h2>



           <p>There is a clear tendency for students to choose to study outside of their given district for traditional schools in the 33 Town area. The key findings indicate cities such as New Britain and Hartford and the more populous towns tend to experience a larger percentage of their students leaving to attain education elsewhere. Certain respective districts have grown vs. others which have decreased, but as a county, the 33 Town area is experiencing split results from 2016-2022 school years. The largest growth however, is Hartford and they are on the rise as well as all of the other urban and more populated areas.
