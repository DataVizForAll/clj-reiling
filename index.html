          <h2>The Question: Introduction</h2>
         

          <p>For my Question, in Build 4 Create Meaningful Data Story I will be addressing A3: In each town, how many students are educated in a different district, and how has it changed over time? This data matters because Connecticut education systems and schools need to be aware if students are seeking education and learning from outside their district. Is this because they find charter, magnet, and technical schools better? Or is it because they are not offered a beneficial opportunity within their public, in their district? These questions are explored by my map making. </p>

          <h2>My Steps to Find my Answers</h2>
          
          <p>For my information, I had to look into the data from all 33 Hartford area Districts. Each town was reported with total students educated from their district. According to CT.Gov|EDSIGHT, they reported the total enrollment for each respective town or district. To address my question, I had to calculate the total number of students educated outside of their district. For this, I took the total number of residents educated in said district, or the enrollment number, and subtracted it by the students in the ‘Public School’ section. This shows the difference of students that are not educated in the districts’ traditional public schools. To calculate this change of time I had to then look into data from previous years. I chose the earliest year I could find, the years 2016-2017. I was given a number, which resembled mostly a smaller change, except for Manchester, Bloomfield, East Hartford, Hartford, New Britain, Windsor, and West Hartford. I then added the total enrollment. My next calculation was the percent educated outside of traditional schools in the district. These numbers allowed for a more precise understanding of each town's disparity and students getting educated somewhere else. I also did the same thing for the 2021-2022 data.</p>

          <h2>Finding My Answers</h2>
          <p>Sheet3 in my data tab shows the percentage point difference from 2017-2022, showing the gradual growth or decline of the percentage of students being educated outside of the traditional school in their given town. **Here is the percentage change of the findings I found** Here is the live link to the choropleth map I created highlighting the changes from the years 2016-2022 https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vbeuS/2/.</p>

          <p> From the year 2021-2022, you can see the darker toned shades of blue are districts with students tending to be more likely educated outside their traditional school. Here is the live link with this map I created. https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nnfhc/1/ 
It is important to also highlight the percentage point difference, which gives a key indicator whether the district has grown or decreased in students being educated outside of the given district they were intended to be educated by a traditional school. Here is the live link map to this Choropleth map. https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vBXbW/1/.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion and Credits/Work cited</h2>

          <p>This is crucial to the understanding of my growth and decline findings. As you can see, the largest growth was for Hartford and Bloomfield at 9.3% for Hartford and 6.9% for Bloomfield. This growth can be attributed to the largest number of magnet and charter schools in Hartford. Students here have the easiest accessibility to get to these schools since they are in close proximity to their homes. The two districts with the largest decline were Windsor and Coventry with Windsor at a 2% decrease and Coventry at 1.5% decrease. This is a sign for these respective school districts that students are tending to come back to their respective traditional schools over the last 5 school years. 
In regards to sheet 2, the percentage change in students from 2017-2022 has either grown or decreased. In the case for Avon, their school district saw a 68.6% increase of students educated outside their district. In the 2016-2017 school year, Avon had a total of 86 students educated outside of their traditional school district. In 2021-2022 they had 145 students educated outside of their traditional school district. This can be correlated to a 2.0% Point Percentage increase as well. 
</p>

           <p>There is no clear tendency for students to choose to study outside of their given district for traditional schools in Hartford County. Certain respective districts have grown vs. others which have decreased, but as a county, Hartford County is experiencing split results from 2016-2022 school years. The largest growth however, is Hartford and they are on the rise.
