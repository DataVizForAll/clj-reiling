          <h2>Exploring The Question: Introduction</h2>
         

          <p>For my Question,  I dove into the research of students' education, specifically if they are leaving their traditional schools to receive outside education. This data is crucial to towns and districts because they need to be aware of the percent of students staying within their district to receive education. Districts can look at this percentage of students leaving their traditional school in correlation with how their school systems are performing, or if there are enough opportunities being offered. However, we found districts with the highest populations had students tending to leave more often such as Hartford or New Britain which are considered cities. One key question we explored was are these students not being offered a beneficial opportunity within their public, in their district?   </p>

          <h2>My Key Findings</h2>
          
          <p>We found the majority of students who left tend to be from these cities such as Hartford, New Britain, and Bloomfield. In this Choropleth Map, we found this information through the data taken from the school years 2016-2017 to 2021-2022. You can clearly see the percentage point difference map illustrates the change in time and the percentage increase of students leaving their district to receive education outside their traditional district for Hartford, Bloomfield, East Hartford, Manchester, and New Britain. In the 2016-2017 school year, Avon had a total of 86 students educated outside of their traditional school district. In 2021-2022 they had 145 students educated outside of their traditional school district. This can be correlated to a 2.0% Point Percentage increase as well.<a href='https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vBXbW/2/'> Here is a live link chart of the information </a> . Why does this matter? For towns such as Windsor, they have a better understanding students are staying within their region to be educated. Windsor and other towns like Coventry know that their education system can be credited to some success over the last 6 school years, but more importantly, they know students and families are depending on their traditional schools now more than ever. </p>

          <h2>Finding My Answers</h2>
          <p>Sheet3 in my data tab shows the percentage point difference from 2017-2022, showing the gradual growth or decline of the percentage of students being educated outside of the traditional school in their given town. **Here is the percentage change of the findings I found** Here is the live link to the choropleth map I created highlighting the changes from the years 2016-2022 https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vbeuS/2/.</p>

          <p> From the year 2021-2022, you can see the darker toned shades of blue are districts with students tending to be more likely educated outside their traditional school. Here is the live link with this map I created. https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nnfhc/1/ 
It is important to also highlight the percentage point difference, which gives a key indicator whether the district has grown or decreased in students being educated outside of the given district they were intended to be educated by a traditional school. Here is the live link map to this Choropleth map. https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/vBXbW/1/.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion and Credits/Work cited</h2>

          <p>This is crucial to the understanding of my growth and decline findings. As you can see, the largest growth was for Hartford and Bloomfield at 9.3% for Hartford and 6.9% for Bloomfield. This growth can be attributed to the largest number of magnet and charter schools in Hartford. Students here have the easiest accessibility to get to these schools since they are in close proximity to their homes. The two districts with the largest decline were Windsor and Coventry with Windsor at a 2% decrease and Coventry at 1.5% decrease. This is a sign for these respective school districts that students are tending to come back to their respective traditional schools over the last 5 school years. 
In regards to sheet 2, the percentage change in students from 2017-2022 has either grown or decreased. In the case for Avon, their school district saw a 68.6% increase of students educated outside their district. In the 2016-2017 school year, Avon had a total of 86 students educated outside of their traditional school district. In 2021-2022 they had 145 students educated outside of their traditional school district. This can be correlated to a 2.0% Point Percentage increase as well. 
</p>

           <p>There is no clear tendency for students to choose to study outside of their given district for traditional schools in Hartford County. Certain respective districts have grown vs. others which have decreased, but as a county, Hartford County is experiencing split results from 2016-2022 school years. The largest growth however, is Hartford and they are on the rise.
